# Airbnb-Case-Study

Overview
This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from Airbnb data, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery as travel resumed. The study was conducted using Python for data cleaning, exploration, and basic visualizations, with Tableau used to create interactive dashboards for storytelling.

#Objectives:
The goal of this case study is to:

Analyze Airbnb listings, reviews, and booking trends.
Understand the impact of the pandemic on Airbnb's revenue and recovery post-COVID.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

Tools & Technologies:
Python: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis (using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
Tableau: For advanced visualizations and dashboard creation.
Jupyter Notebooks: For executing and presenting Python code.

Methodology:
Data Collection: Airbnb data on listings, reviews, and bookings was collected from open sources.
Data Cleaning: Duplicates were removed, missing values handled, and data types converted (e.g., prices, dates).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Python was used to uncover trends such as price distributions, review patterns, and occupancy rates.
Tableau Visualization: Cleaned data was visualized in Tableau to create interactive dashboards, highlighting booking trends, revenue fluctuations, and customer preferences.
Insights & Recommendations: The final analysis identified key insights and offered recommendations for Airbnbâ€™s recovery strategy.


Key Findings:
The Theatre District had the highest number of reviews per month.
Bedford had the highest availability of listings.
Revenue and bookings saw a significant drop during the pandemic but have been recovering steadily as travel resumed.
